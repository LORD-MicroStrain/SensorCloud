# SensorCloudâ„¢ Python SDK

## Testing ##
To run tests execute `python -m unittest discover -v` from SDK/Python.  Tests run on python 2.7 and depend on **[mock](https://pypi.org/project/mock/)**.

To debug tests I've found that **[nose2](https://pypi.org/project/nose2/)** works really well.  Just run `nose2` from SDK/Python.
