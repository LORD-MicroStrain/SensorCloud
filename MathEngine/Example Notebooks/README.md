### Example Notebooks ###

[MathEngine Tutorial](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/MathEngine_Tutorial.ipynb) - A tutorial notebook for getting started with MathEngine and SensorCloud data.

[Bearing Data Analysis](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/Lab%20Bearing%20Analysis.ipynb) - Performs frequency analysis on burst data to monitor bearing health.

[Notch Filter](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/LORD%20Notch%20Filter.ipynb)- A method to apply a bandstop or notch filter to a data set for the purpose of removing a specific series of frequency components.

[External Data Sources - Weather Underground](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/External%20Data%20Sources%20-%20Weather%20Underground.ipynb) - Demonstrates pulling in data from a 3rd party API, and adding the data as new channels in SensorCloud.

[Demo Structures](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/Demo%20Structures.ipynb) - Demonstrates Simple MathEngine tools for structural analysis.

[Stock Market Analysis](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/Stock_Market_Analysis.ipynb) - Script which pulls data from Yahoo Finance in CSV format, parses it into numpy arrays, and demonstrates plotting of datasets with matlabplotlib.

[Email Report](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/Email%20Graph%20Image.ipynb) - Demonstrates how to embed a graph image generated by MathEngine into an email report.

[Scale Channel Axes](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/MathEngine/Example%20Notebooks/Scale%20Channels.ipynb) - Provides a quick script for taking two chunks of data, and scaling their time axes and using two Y axes for direct comparison.
