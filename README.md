# SensorCloud™ GitHub

SensorCloud is a unique sensor data storage, visualization and remote management platform that leverages powerful Cloud computing technologies to provide excellent data scalability, rapid visualization, and user programmable analysis. SensorCloud's core features include FastGraph, MathEngine®, LiveConnect, and the OpenData API.

The following resources are provided to help communicate with SensorCloud via the OpenData API in various programming languages.

If you have any questions, please email <support@sensorcloud.com>.

## API ##
The documentation for out RESTful Web API can be found [here.](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/API/README.md)

## SDKs
Software Development Kits are provided that can be used to easily communicate with SensorCloud using the Open Data API.

**[Java SDK](https://github.com/LordMicrostrain/SensorCloud/tree/master/SDK/Java)**

**[C# SDK](https://github.com/LordMicrostrain/SensorCloud/tree/master/SDK/CSharp)**

## LabView
SensorCloud provides VI's which allow your LabVIEW applications to communicate with SensorCloud. They are designed to work for desktop applications and embedded devices like the **NI CompactRIO**. They make it simple to authorize devices, register sensors, and send data from within your LabView code.

Please see the **[LabVIEW SDK wiki](https://github.com/LordMicrostrain/SensorCloud/wiki/LabView-SDK)** for more information.

## Example Code
Example code is provided that demonstrates using the SDKs for authentication, adding a sensor to a device, and uploading data using the SensorCloud Open Data API. 

**[Python Example Code](https://github.com/LordMicrostrain/SensorCloud/tree/master/Example%20Code/Python)**

**[Java Example Code](https://github.com/LordMicrostrain/SensorCloud/tree/master/Example%20Code/Java)**
